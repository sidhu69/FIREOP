‚ú® The Easy Way ‚ú®
Deploy

‚öîÔ∏è The Normal Way ‚öîÔ∏è
Simply clone the repository and run the main file:

git clone https://github.com/HellBoy-OP/HellBot
cd HellBot
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# <Create local_config.py with variables as given below>
python3 -m userbot
An example local_config.py file could be:

Not All of the variables are mandatory

The Userbot should work by setting only the first two variables

from heroku_config import Var

class Development(Var):
  APP_ID = 6
  API_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
UniBorg Configuration
The UniBorg Config is situated in userbot/uniborgConfig.py.

Heroku Configuration Simply just leave the Config as it is.

Local Configuration Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

Mandatory Vars
Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
This is because of telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError
APP_ID: You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
API_HASH: You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
